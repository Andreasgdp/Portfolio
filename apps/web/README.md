# Generating Global Doc ID

Every document (except docs index page) has a unique eight-character `global_id` property. This uniquely identifies that piece of documentation and provides a seamless way to be able to reorganize documentation without worrying about 404 errors for missing redirects.

These can be automatically generated by running the following command:

    node scripts/generate-page-ids.mjs
