## What is `git rerere`?

- **Stands for**: "Reuse Recorded Resolution"
- **Function**: Automates resolution of merge conflicts by remembering past resolutions.
- **Activation**:
  ```bash
  git config --global rerere.enabled true
  ```
  - Enables `rerere` across all repositories.
  - Use without `--global` flag for specific repositories.

## Benefits of `git rerere` in Rebasing:

- **Simplifies Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolves recurring conflicts from previous rebases.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time and complexity in resolving conflicts during rebase.

## Under The Hood:

- **Storage**:
  - Stored under `.git/rr-cache` directory.
  - Three files for each conflict:
    1. **Preimage (pre)**: State of content before conflict.
    2. **Postimage (post)**: State of content after conflict resolution.
    3. **Status**: Metadata including unique conflict identifiers.

## Usage Tips:

- **Workflow Efficiency**: Useful for long-lived branches and team collaboration.
- **Caution**:
  - Be cautious when using `rerere`; can resolve conflicts in unexpected ways. If this happens, might need to delete irrelevant recordings.
- **Clean Commit Tree**: Small, traceable changes lead to small, easily fixable conflicts.

By mastering `git rerere`, you can streamline complex rebase operations and improve workflow efficiency.
