title: Update Dev Branch With Latest From Main
excerpt: Update Dev Branch With Latest From Main
---

There are two ways of getting the latest changes from the main branch (or any other branch for that matter)

## TL;DR

Merge the latest changes from the remote main branch into the current branch: `git merge origin/main`

Use rebase instead of merge to get the latest changes from the remote main branch: `git pull --rebase origin main`

## Merge

Being on the dev branch, you can merge the latest changes in from main using the following command:

```bash
git merge main
```

This will merge the latest changes from the local main branch into your current branch.

That, however, might not be up to date with the remote main branch. To get the latest changes from the remote main branch, you can run the following command:

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

### Usecases for merging

- You want to keep the history of the main branch in your dev branch
- There are a lot of commits in the dev branch, so a rebase would be too much work

## Rebase

If you want to use rebase instead of merge, you can use the following command:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This will rebase your current branch on top of the main branch. This will make your history linear and easier to read.

### Usecases for rebasing

- You want to keep a clean history that better represents the actual changes
- You want to have more control over the history of your branch
