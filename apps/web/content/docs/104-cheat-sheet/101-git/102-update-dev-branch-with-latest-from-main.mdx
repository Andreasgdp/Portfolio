excerpt: Update Dev Branch With Latest From Main
---

Being on the dev branch, run the following command to pull the latest changes from the main branch:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you want to use rebase instead of merge (or whatever is the default config for you), you can use the following command:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```
