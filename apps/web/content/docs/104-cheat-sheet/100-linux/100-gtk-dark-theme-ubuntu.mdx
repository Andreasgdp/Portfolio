title: GTK Dark Theme on Ubuntu
excerpt: Awesomewm, gtk, dark theme, ubuntu

# Issue

When using ubuntu it can happen that the gtk theme is not correctly set to dark. This can be the case when using a window manager like `awesomewm`. This means that chrome will use light mode as the default. If you want to use dark mode you have to set the gtk theme to dark.


# Solution

This can be done like this:

You'll need to touch this file for gtk3: `/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`

For apps using older gtk2: `/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc`

For qt apps I suggest you to install `qt5ct` package (`sudo apt install qt5ct`).

Sample of /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini:

```
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name = breeze-gtk-theme
gtk-icon-theme-name = Numix
gtk-font-name = Roboto Regular 11
gtk-xft-antialias = 1
gtk-xft-hinting = 0
gtk-xft-hintstyle = hintmedium
gtk-recent-files-enabled = false
gtk-enable-animations = false
gtk-cursor-theme-name = Amiga
gtk-decoration-layout = close,menu
```

Sample of /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:

```
gtk-theme-name = "Xfce-smooth"
gtk-icon-theme-name = "Numix"
gtk-font-name = "Roboto Regular 11"
gtk-xft-antialias = 1
gtk-enable-animations = 0
gtk-enable-event-sounds = 0
gtk-enable-input-feedback-sounds = 0
```

You can uncomment to set the commented options if you like.

For qt, after you install qt5ct package you can execute `qt5ct`, which will present you with a GUI app to set the qt apps theme or sync it to the gtk one.

Also you need `lxappearance`:

```
sudo apt install lxappearance
```

Just run `lxappearance` and select a dark theme. After logout and login you should have dark theme.
