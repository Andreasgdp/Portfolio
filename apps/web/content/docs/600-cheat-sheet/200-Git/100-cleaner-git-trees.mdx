## Problem:

- **Merge commits**: Standard but messy
- **Environmental impact**: Wastes time, resources, and finances

## Solution:

- **Interactive Rebase**: Clean up commit history before merging to main branch
- **Benefits**: Cleaner history, easier issue identification, efficient bug finding

## How to Use Interactive Rebase:

1. **Start on Your Feature Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

2. **Grab the Latest Main Branch Updates Without Switching:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main:main
   ```

3. **Interactive Rebase Time:**

   ```bash
   git rebase main --interactive
   ```

   - Pick and choose commits to keep or squash (`s` to squash) to clean up history while preserving changes.

4. **Safely Update the Remote Branch:**

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

   - Ensures no accidental overwriting of others' work.

5. **Prepare to Merge:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

6. **Merge Without Extra Commits:**

   ```bash
   git merge --ff-only
   ```

   - Keeps history straight, avoiding merge commits.

7. **Push it Up:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

By integrating this process into daily workflows, Git trees remain clean and manageable.
