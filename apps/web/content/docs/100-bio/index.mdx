Hi, I'm [Andreas Petersen (Guldberg)](https://guldberg.dev).

I'm an engineer by heart with a passion for building tools and learning new technologies. I'm currently working at [Universal Robots](https://universal-robots.com) in Odense, Denmark as a student worker in Software Development. I'm also studying for a bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering at [SDU](https://sdu.dk/en/).

# Why Software Development and Robotics?

Why work in software development when I'm studying robotics? Well, I've always been interested in software development and how the tools we use are built. I also believe that software development is a great skill to have when working with robotics, which is why I've worked in sofware development, as well as worked on several software projects in my spare time while studying robotics.

Personally, I believe that great software is the key to great development in all fields, but especially in robotics. Robotics is a very complex field in it's own right so having great tools to work with is not to be able to scale, but also for keeping complexity at bay is very important.
