# Student Worker - Software Engineer

My work with Universal Robots started in 2021, when I was hired as a student worker. I was hired to work on the PolyScope X project, which is a new version of the software that runs on the Universal Robots robots. PolyScope X is built using Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx, SCSS and Git and is the software serving the user interface for the robots. PolyScope X is a complete rewrite of the existing software, which is built using Java. PolyScope X is built using a micro frontend architecture, specifically defined as URCaps which allows 3rd party developers to develop their own applications for the robots.

## My Work

- Development of features for PolyScope X e.g. an input dialog.
- Development of the URCaps SDK, which is the SDK used by 3rd party developers to develop their own applications for the robots.
- Unit tests using Jest.
- End-to-end tests using Cypress.
- Development of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
- General bug fixing.

# Engineering Intern - Control Systems

During my internship, I aimed to grow both professionally and personally, setting specific goals to enhance communication, problem-solving, and time management skills. Through a series of targeted objectives, I strived to become more adept at collaborating effectively, handling tasks efficiently, and leading solutions in robotics-related domains.

## My Work

- Torque Window Solution
  - Addressed customer issue with small torque windows in a robot configuration.
  - Implemented embedded C and controller C++ code for adjusting torque windows, improving performance and efficiency.
- Code Refactoring for Configurations
  - Centralized specific configurations, reducing code complexity.
  - Enhanced code maintainability and readability for easier modifications.
- Investigation of Integration Test Failures
  - Analyzed test results and debugged code to identify failures' root causes.
  - Provided insights leading to effective issue resolution and improved test stability.
- Code Linting Caching Solution
  - Developed a caching solution for code linting in CI pipelines.
  - Reduced linting time from ~25 to ~5 minutes, enhancing overall pipeline efficiency.
- Enhanced Power Usage Algorithm
  - Implemented a faster and conservative power usage calculation algorithm.
  - Improved power supply performance and reliability in driving the robot.
- Simulated Robot & Joint Controller Bridge Development
  - Created a communication bridge between simulated robot and joint controller.
  - Demonstrated feasibility for future integration and development.
- Additional Contributions
  - Resolved various bugs and handled smaller assignments, honing technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

This internship allowed for practical experience in software development, embedded systems, debugging, optimization, and integration within robotics technology, offering valuable insights into its complexities.

## Goals and Objectives
