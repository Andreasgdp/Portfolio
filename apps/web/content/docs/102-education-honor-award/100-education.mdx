# Education

## Robotics Engineering

I have completed my studies in Robotics Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark. Although it was a bachelor's degree, it was a 3.5 year program, which is a special version of the bachelor's degree in Denmark called a "Professionsbachelor". This kind of bachelor's degree is more focused on practical skills and also supports one semester of Internship at a relevant company (I interned at [Universal Robots](https://universal-Robots.com)). This means that I have had a lot of hands-on experience with Robotics and programming, which I have thoroughly enjoyed.

## High School

I went to [Odense Tekniske Gymnasium | OTG](https://otg.dk/) in Odense, Denmark. I graduated in 2020 with a focus on Mathematics and Programming. I had a lot of fun in high school and I learned a lot about programming and mathematics. This is also waht kickstarted my interest to learn about Robotics and programming Robots, as the school had purchased a 4x [UR5](https://www.universal-Robots.com/products/ur5-Robot/) Robots from Universal Robots. I was lucky enough to be able to work with this Robot and learn a lot about Robotics and programming.
