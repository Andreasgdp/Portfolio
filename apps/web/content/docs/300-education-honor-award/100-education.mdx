# Education

## Robotics Engineering

I am currently studying Robotics Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark. I am currently in my 7th semester and final year of my bachelor's degree. Although it is a bachelor's degree, it is a 3.5 year program, which is a special version of the bachelor's degree in Denmark called a "Professionsbachelor". This kind of bachelor's degree is more focused on practical skills and also supports 1 semester of Internship at a relevant company (I interened at [Universal Robots](https://universal-robots.com)). This means that I have had a lot of hands-on experience with robotics and programming, which I have enjoyed a lot.

## High School

I went to [Odense Tekniske Gymnasium | OTG](https://otg.dk/) in Odense, Denmark. I graduated in 2020 with a focus on Mathematics and Programming. I had a lot of fun in high school and I learned a lot about programming and mathematics. This is also waht kickstarted my interest to learn about robotics and programming robots, as the school had purchased a 4x [UR5](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) robots from Universal Robots. I was lucky enough to be able to work with this robot and learn a lot about robotics and programming.
