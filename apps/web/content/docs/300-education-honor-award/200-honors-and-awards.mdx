## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is a time limited event where people from different backgrounds come together to work on a project to learn something new. The project can be anything from a new product, a new feature for an existing product, a new way of working, a new marketing campaign, a new business model, a new way of organizing the company, etc. The only requirement is that it is new and that it can be done in the time limit of the hackathon.

## The team

The team consisted of 3 people, two from the software department developing PolyScope X (me being one of them) and one from the software department developing control software for the robots. The team was formed by the team members themselves, and the team members were chosen based on their skills and interests.

## What did we do?

Though I am unable to disclose the details of the project, I can say that it was a prototype of a new feature for [PolyScope X](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/polyscope-x/), which is the next generation of the software that runs on the Universal Robots robots. And because of how far we got with the prototype in the Hackathon, not only did we win this award, we also got the opportunity to continue working on the project as part of our daily work. Hopefully the feature will be part of a future release of PolyScope X and I will be able to share more details about it then.

## Why this award?

The reason we won this award was because of the way we worked together as a team. We were able to include multiple colleagues from different fields to solve problems and learn from each other. We were able to share knowledge and learn from each other about the new feature we were developing. And we were able to do all of this in a very short amount of time.
