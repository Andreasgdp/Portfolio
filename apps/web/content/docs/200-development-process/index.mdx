## Development Process

1. **Research** - Research the problem and the best way to solve it. This includes looking at existing solutions and how they work.
1. **Design/Prototype** - Design a solution to the problem. This includes creating a prototype of the solution in order to better understand the problem and how to solve it.
1. **Develop** - Develop the solution. This includes writing the code, testing it, and making sure it works.
1. **Deploy** - Deploy the solution. This includes making sure it works in production.
1. **Maintain** - Maintain the solution. This includes making sure it continues to work in production.


## Research

Research is the first step in my development process. It is the most important step because it allows me to understand the problem and start the problem solving process with a good understanding of the tools available for solving the problem.

## Design/Prototype

Designing a solution to the problem is the second step in my development process. In my time as a developer, I have found that designing a solution to a problem in many cases cannot be done well without first having a solid understanding the problem. This is why I always start with research first for one, but also why I always start with a prototype*. A prototype allows me to better understand the problem and how to solve it. It also allows me to test my solution before I start writing code. This is important because it allows me to more easily identify problems with my solution and be able to design a more robust and fitting solution.

*Note: I do not always start with a prototype. Sometimes I will start with a design and then go straight to writing code. This is usually when I am working on a project that is very similar to something I have done before and I already have a good understanding of the problem and how to solve it.

## Develop

Developing the solution is the third step in my development process. This is where I write the code for the solution. This includes writing tests for the code and making sure it works.

## Deploy

Deploying the solution is the fourth step in my development process. Depending on the project, this part of the process differs in how it should be understood. For example, if I am working on a project that is a website, then deploying the solution means making sure it works in production. If I am working on a project in an enterprise environment developing software for industrial use, then deploying the solution means the same thing, but not necessarily in production and not necessarily accessible to the public as there are more time inbetween releases and more testing that needs to be done before releasing the software to the public. In either case, deploying the solution means making sure it works in together with the rest of the software intended to be used for the next production release.

## Maintain

Maintaining the solution is the fifth step in my development process. In it's simplest form, this means making sure the solution continues to not only work, but also that it keeps being relevant and fulfilling the user's needs. If this is not the case, then it is time to go back to the drawing board and start the process over again with new key insight in what the user needs. This is why I always try to keep the user in mind when developing a solution to a problem.
