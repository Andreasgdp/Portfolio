In this project, we have worked to make a gripper that can be mounted on and integrated with a UR5 robot. The gripper has been 3D modelled, 3D printed and mounted on a UR5 robot. The gripper is controlled by the movements of a motor located in the center of the gripper. The engine receives signals to go in each direction at varying speed from an electrical circuit which receives signals from a C++ program running on a Raspberry Pi. We have made a URCaps extension for ours grabs a UR5. We have made an XML-RPC server running on a Raspberry Pi to be able to communicate with the URCaps extension. With this XML-RPC communication we have the opportunity to to control the gripper from a UR program running on the UR5 robot with our URCaps extension. We have also made a GUI running alongside the server on the Raspberry Pi that we can use to control the gripper directly.
