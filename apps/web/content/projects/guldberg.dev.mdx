# guldberg.dev

This is the website you're looking at. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Originally, this project is based on [this template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-portfolio-pageview-counter), but I've made some changes since, but plan to make it more unique in the future.
