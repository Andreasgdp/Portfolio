# License of Documentation using Contentlayer

The license located beside this readme file applies to the logic of the implementation of this site, which originates from the [Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer).

This applies to the following files:
app/components/docs/_
app/docs/_

The plan is to rework the documentation to be more specific to this project, but for now, the license is the same as the Contentlayer project.
